### Summary: 

In this project, I explore the impacts of different components of an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) for tumor segmentation in the 2D MRI Brain Tumor Image Dataset.
I propose the CNN model shown in Figure above and compare the performance of **ResNet-18** and **VGG-16 backbones**. The influence of data augmentation techniques is examined, followed by an exploration of various modifications in the decoder architecture, including different upsampling levels, skip connections, and dilated convolutions. I also compare the effectiveness of **Binary Cross Entropy (BCE)** and **Dice loss functions** in training the model.

Experimental results indicate that, for this dataset, ResNet-18 is a better choice for the backbone, and BCE results in slightly better training performance. Additionally, using dilated convolutions in the decoder improves segmentation results. Moreover, augmentation helps increase the modelâ€™s generalizability.

### Methods:
In this project, I used PyTorch to develop and train neural network models for improving semantic segmentation in brain tumors. I experimented with various architectures, including ResNet-18, ResNet-34, and VGG16, and tuned hyperparameters such as learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizers to enhance model performance. To increase data diversity and improve generalization, I applied common data augmentation techniques in addition elastic deformation.  I evaluated different loss functions, including cross-entropy and Dice loss, to identify the most effective approach for segmentation tasks. Model performance was assessed using metrics like IoU and Dice Coefficient.

### Summary: 
I implemented several neural network models including **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, **Xception**, and **MobileNet**. These models utilized data augmentation, generation, and normalization techniques to enhance robustness across various datasets. Through extensive experiments, I fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize accuracy and reduce loss. I visualized performance metrics such as accuracy and loss curves, and confusion matrices to compare the effectiveness of each model in classifying different tumor categories.

- Analyzed fMRI image variability's impact on surface EEG and developed a cortical EEG pattern model.
- Proposed two criteria for Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filter selection to enhance motor imagery neurofeedback for neuroscientists.
- Preliminary finding: Plausibility of CSP filters can be measured through simulated anatomical patterns, not always through Event-Related Distribution.
- Analyzed and visualized data using MATLAB, presenting results in the Master's Thesis.
