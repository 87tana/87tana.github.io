## Selected Projects

### [NLP Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/87tana/NLP_SentimentAnalysis)
<p align="center">
    <img width="500" src="/images/prom_dic_words.png" alt="Material Bread logo">
</p>

- Investigated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis utilizing Python and libraries including **NLTK**, **Spacy**, and **Hugging Face**.
- Conducted EDA and engaged in feature engineering as the initial steps of the project.
- Implemented four text preprocessing combinations, including **basic preprocessing**, **stemming**, and **part of speech (POS)
tagging**, followed by bag-of-words vectorization.
- Evaluated word vocabularies using frequency distributions and word entropies, illustrating that relying solely on word frequencies is inadequate for generating vocabularies.
alone are insufficient for vocabulary generation.
- Recognized Acknowledged the need for exploring TF-IDF and addressing data imbalances to improve sentiment representation and modeling.
