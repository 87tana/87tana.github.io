<p align="center">
    <img width="600" src="/images/csp_selection.jpg" alt="Material Bread logo">
</p>

- Analyzed fMRI image variability's impact on surface EEG and developed a cortical EEG pattern model.
- Proposed two criteria for Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filter selection to enhance motor imagery neurofeedback for neuroscientists.
- Preliminary finding: Plausibility of CSP filters can be measured through simulated anatomical patterns, not always through Event-Related Distribution.
- Analyzed and visualized data using MATLAB, presenting results in the Master's Thesis.
