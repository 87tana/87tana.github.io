### Summery: 

In this project, we aim to enhance image segmentation performance using deep learning techniques. Our primary focus is on developing and evaluating various neural network architectures to determine their effectiveness in segmentation tasks. We experiment with models such as ResNet-18, ResNet-34,ResNet50,  and VGG16 as a backbone exploring different configurations and tuning hyperparameters to optimize their performance. The goal is to identify the most effective architectures and configurations for image segmentation, contributing to advancements in this critical area of computer vision.

### Methods:
In this project, I used PyTorch for developing and training neural network models, conducting several experiments to improve semantic segmentation in brain tumors. I implemented and tested different models, including ResNet-18, ResNet-34, and VGG16 architectures, with various encoder and decoder configurations. To enhance model performance, I experimented with various hyperparameters, such as learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizer settings. I also applied data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, and flipping to increase the diversity of training data and improve model generalization. Different loss functions, including cross-entropy loss and Dice loss, were evaluated to identify the most effective approach for segmentation tasks. Model performance was assessed using metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 score to ensure comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, I used visualization tools like Matplotlib and OpenCV for visualizing segmentation results and monitoring training progress.

### Summary: 
I implemented several neural network models including **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, **Xception**, and **MobileNet**. These models utilized data augmentation, generation, and normalization techniques to enhance robustness across various datasets. Through extensive experiments, I fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize accuracy and reduce loss. I visualized performance metrics such as accuracy and loss curves, and confusion matrices to compare the effectiveness of each model in classifying different tumor categories.

### Methods:
