### [NLP Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/87tana/NLP_SentimentAnalysis)
<p align="center">
    <img width="400" src="/images/title_image.jpg" alt="Material Bread logo">
</p>

 Explored NLP techniques for sentiment analysis using Python and libraries such as NLTK, SpacCy, Hugging face
- Performed EDA, feature engineering as initial project steps.
- Implemented four text preprocessing combinations, including basic preprocessing, stemming, and part of speech (POS)
tagging, followed by bag-of-words vectorization.
- Evaluated word vocabularies based on frequency distributions and word entropies, demonstrating that word frequencies
alone are insufficient for vocabulary generation.
- Identified the need for alternative vectorization methods, such as TF-IDF, and emphasized the need to address data
imbalance for more meaningful sentiment representation and modeling

<p align="center">
    <img width="600" src="/images/csp_selection.jpg" alt="Material Bread logo">
</p>

- Analyzed fMRI image variability's impact on surface EEG and developed a cortical EEG pattern model.
- Proposed two criteria for Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filter selection to enhance motor imagery neurofeedback for neuroscientists.
- Preliminary finding: Plausibility of CSP filters can be measured through simulated anatomical patterns, not always through Event-Related Distribution.
- Analyzed and visualized data using MATLAB, presenting results in the Master's Thesis.
